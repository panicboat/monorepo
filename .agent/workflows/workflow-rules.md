# Workflow Rules

- **Architectural Changes**: Any changes that affect the system architecture, including database schema strategies, library replacements, or major pattern changes, MUST be explicitly approved by the user before implementation. Propose these changes in an implementation plan or OpenSpec proposal first.
- **OpenSpec Archival**: Upon confirming with the user that a task is complete, you MUST archive the corresponding OpenSpec change using `openspec archive` to finalize the workflow.
