# Coding Rules

Please strictly follow these rules:

- Write code comments in English.
- Use Japanese for chat and documentation.
- Use Japanese for implementation plan and walkthrough.
- Do not include change descriptions in code comments or method names. Make them understandable for the current state.
- Do not use comparative expressions like "simple" or "complex" anywhere.
- Code consistency is important. Ensure modifications maintain consistency with existing code.

# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
