# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Coding Rules

Please strictly follow these rules:

- Write code comments in English.
- Use Japanese for chat and documentation.
- Do not include change descriptions in code comments or method names. Make them understandable for the current state.
- Do not use comparative expressions like "simple" or "complex" anywhere.
- Code consistency is important. Ensure modifications maintain consistency with existing code.
